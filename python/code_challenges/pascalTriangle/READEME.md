Pascal’s Triangle is a collection of numbers that take a particular form:
```
    [1]
   [1,1]
  [1,2,1]
 [1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```

The rows continue on forever. Assuming that row N = 1 corresponds to that first row, [1], write a function that takes in N as a value and prints the first N rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

Ex: N = 4

```
pascal(4) => [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1]]
```
