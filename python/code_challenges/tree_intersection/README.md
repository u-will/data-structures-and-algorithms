## Problem Domain:

Find common values in 2 binary treesr

## Algorithm:
- create folder named tree_intersection which contains a file called tree_intersection.py
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees
